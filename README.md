      * Of Ruling Elders.

      * A more speciall consideration of Ruling Elders, Deacons, and Widdowes. 1 Tim. 5. 17.

Object. 2. But Paul doth here understand by him that ruleth well, the civill Magistrate.

Object. 3. By those who rule well, are understood Deacons, who take care of the poore.

O•. 4. By these who rule well, are understord, Bishops, who for age, cannot preach yet rule well.

Ob. 5. By ruling well he meaneth a holy life, so as he meaneth not only that Pastors should live holily, but also preach painfully.

Ob. 6. The Rulers here ought to have wages, as workmen, but your Elders have no wages. Ergo, your Elders are not in this Text.

Ob. 7. If there be two sorts of Elders here, there must be two sorts of Bishops, for Presbyter and Bishop are synonyma, and one and the same, as is cleare, Tit. 1. 6, 7. Acts 20. 17. They are called Elders, and v. 28. Bishops. But we cannot admit of two sorts of Bishops: some to rule, and some to preach, that were Antichristian.

Ob. 8. That office is not in Scripture, whose Characters, qualities, and notes are not specified in Scripture, as the Characters of a Deacon are, 1 Tim. 3. and of a Bishop ibid. But the Characters, qualites and notes of a ruling Elder are not in the Scripture, Ergo, &c.

Ob. 9. But it is but a generall, that he rule, we have not these wherein the particulars of his ruling, consist.

Ob. 10. But if ruling be the specifick and essentiall note of the ruling Elder, he cannot be a speciall officer different from the preaching Elder, for what is essentiall to one species cannot agree to another, and what constituteth one species, doth not agree to another.

Ob. 11. The Keyes are not given to this ruling Elder, Ergo, he is no lawfull officer: the antecedent is proved, the keyes of jurisdiction, because they can operate nothing, but by the Key of knowledge, cannot be given to this new officer, now the key of knowledge is given only to the preaching Elder.

Ob. 12. But how is it proved that Ruling Elders are of divine institution?

Ob. 13. But the ruling in diligence, Rom. 12. 8. and the governments, 1 Cor. 12. 28. are generalls, and so cannot constitute a speciall office, in the body: for it is against logick, that that which is generall, and common to all the officers, can constitute a species, or a speciall kind:

Ob. 14. But Rom. 12. 8. the Apostle speaketh of divers gifts, as v. 6. having then gifts, differing according to the grace, that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophecy, &c. Ergo, the Apostle doth not speak of divers offices. 2. One and the same man may both teach, and exhort, and therefore Pastor and Doctor are not here differenced. 3. The Deacons office shall be here described, by the interjection of the ruling Elder, but the two acts of the deacon, which is to give with simplicity, and, to shew mercy with cheerefulnesse, and which is an insolent order, therfore the Apostle doth not here ennumerate divers offices.

      * Of Deacons.

Object. 1. There is not one word of Deacons, Acts 6. not oneword of the poverty of widows, and these seven were but civill curators and tutors of the widows, and not Church-officers, for any thing that can be collected from Gods Word.

Object. 2. It is evident from the Text that these Deacons were not of divine institution, but of a meere temporary erection, for the present necessity of the Church. First, it is said they were appointed, Acts 6. 1. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉. Secondly, they were erected upon occasion of the multiplying of the disciples. Thirdly, upon occasion of the poverty of widows, and therefore when there be no poore, there is no need of Deacons, and so it is but an office of a temporary standing in the Church.

Ob. 3. But if the civill Magistrate had been a friend to the Church, Acts 6. his place had beene to care for the poore, for the law of nature obligeth him to take care of the poore, therefore did a woman in the famine at the siege of Samaria cry, Helpe O King; and if this were done by Christian Magistrates, Pastors should be eased thereof, that they might give themselves to the Word and Prayer, and there should be no neede of a divine positive institution of Deacons for this charge.

Object. 4. But the occasion of appointing Deacons was to disburden the Pastor, who was to give himselfe wholy to preaching and praying; Ergo, at the first the Apostles and so also Pastors were Deacons; if therefore the poore be fewer then they were at Ierusalem, Act. 6. where the Church did exceedingly multiplie; this Office of Deaconry was to returne to the Pastors, as its prime and native subject; and therefore is not essentially and primarily an Office separated from the Pastors Office. And if the poore cease to be at all, the Office ceaseth also.

Object. 5. But if there were a community of goods, and no man lacked any thing, Act. 5. 34. there were no poore at all, and so no need of Deacons.

Object. 6. Distribution of earthly goods is not such a thing, at requireth a spirituall Office; for money given by a Church-officer hath no spirituall influence on the poores necessity, more then money given by the Magistrate, or one who hath no Church-office.

Object. 7. The Office of a Deacon is not mentioned in the Word, and what should be his charge is scarcely holden forth in Scripture.

Object. 8. But it would seem, that a Deacon hath a higher imployment then to distribute goods, and that he is to preach, as Stephen and Philip did: for 1. they did choose men Act. 6. full of the Holy Ghost; now to be full of the holy Ghost is a requisite in a preacher, and is not required in a man to distribute money; yea these who are least esteemed in the Church, 1 Cor. 6. 4. may judge in things pertaining to this life, Ergo, they may suffice to distribute〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, things which belong to this life.

Object, 9. 1 Tim. 3. 9. The Deacon must hold the mystery of the faith; Ergo, he must be able to preach.

Object. 10. The Deacon must be the husband of one wife, ruling his children and his own house well 1 Tim. 3. 12. Ergo, he must be able to governe the Church well, no l•sse then the Pastor of whom the same qualification is required, v. 5. and so the Deacon must be somewhat more then a carer for the poore.

Object. 11. The Deacon by his Office is to serve Tables, Act. 6. 2. that is, to administer the Sacraments, at least he is by office to baptize; for Iesus himselfe baptized not, but his Disciples, Io•. 4. 2. and Christ sent not Paul to baptize, but to preach; therefore the dpostles baptized by others, by Deacons, and by others whose ministery and helpe they used in baptizing, Ergo, the Deacons office is not onely to care for the poore.

Object. 12. Paul, 1 Tim. 3. requireth that the Deacon v. 10. should first be tryed, and thereafter use the office, so he be found blameles; Ergo, the Deacon must be ordained with imposition of hands, as the presbyter, and so must be, by office, some more eminent person, then one who serveth Tables only; for grace was given to
Timothy; by the laying on of hands, 1 Tim. 3. 14. and Chrysostome observeth, that Steven did no miracles; nor did he speak with wisdome, that the adversaries were not able to resist v. 8. 9. 10. till first hee was appointed a Deacon, by imposition of hands, which evidenceth to us more then a poore office of giving almes to the poore.

Ob. 13. How doe those words Act. 6. v. 7. and the word of God grew, and the number of Disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, &c. follow upon the institution of Deacons v. 2, 3 4. 5, 6. if Deacons were not, according to their primitive institution and Office, ordained to be Preachers of the word, by whose paines the word grew?

Ob. 14. But doth not the faithfull administration of the Deacons office, purchase to the Deacon a good degree, that is, doth it make him •••ter in a preparatory way to be a Pastor?

Ob. 1. The power of the Keys cannot be given to the catholick representative Church, or catholick Pr2. It is objected, if the visible catholick Church be the first and principall subject of all Church3. They object; if a single Congregation have not power of Excommunication, and of entire and comple
Ob. 1. Here we cannot understand the Church universall. 1. Because he would not say where two or three are gathered in my Name, I will be in the midst of them, for two or three cannot represent all the Churches comprehended under the catholick visible Body of Jesus Christ.

Ob. 2. The christian magistrate as a nursing father is to punish those who offend, and hath power to command Churches to confesse offences done to sister Churches, and command Church censures, as excommunication, to be used, and Christs power to be put forth in practise, according to the will of Jesus Christ.

Ob. 3. Christ here speaketh for a present and constant removing of scand 〈◊〉 Brother and Brother of one congregation. A cathalick 〈◊〉 of the whole visible Church is far off, •nd cannot be 〈◊〉.

Ob. 4. Then should an universall councell of the whole world be absolutely necessary, if in some cases we must tell the whole catholickchurch

Ob. 5. Refusing communion with sister Churches in case of scand•ll is as effectuall a way for edification, as authoritative excommunicationof congregations by Presbyteries.

Ob. 6. Either must you complaine to a presbyteriall, provinciall, and nationall Church, before you complaine to that congregation of which the 'Delinquent is a member, or after that you have complained to that congregation; if the former be said, then you cannot tell the presbytery, or superior Courts, but in case of obstinacy; for if you can gaine a Brother, or a Church in a private way, you are not to bring him to a more publickeshame, that is contrary to Christs order, v. 15. If he heare thee, thou hast gained thy brother. And if you tell it the Presbytery and the superior Courts, after you have told it to the Church, whereof he is a member, then you make foure steps, in your reclaiming your brother, where Christ hath made but three.

Ob. 7. The Church spoken of, Mat. 18. is all one with the House of God, and the House of Prayer, where two or three agree to pray for onething. v. 19. and the place where worshiping is, and word and Sa•raments, that society in which stewards give a portion of the trea•• of life to every child of the House, Mat. 24. 45, 1 Cor. 4. 1. 2. 〈◊〉 publick Rebukes are tendered to these who sin publickly, before all, that others may feare, 1 Tim. 5. 20. 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉: this must be in the Churches hearing and before the Congregation meet for the Word and Sacraments, for these ordinances of God worke for the edifying both of the party reproved and before all the Congregation, which shall heare and feare; and they worke upon the Heart, as the Word of God doth: now a presbyteriall Church convened in some Elders of divers Congregations, for Church censures and exercise of jurisdiction, is not such a House of God, where are the Word, Sacraments and publick rebukes in the hearing of the Congregation; for the Congregations of all the presbytery being 20. or 30. cannot meet in one Church.

Ob. 8. The Word Church is never used in the New Testament, for the Presbytery; and if it signifie a Representative Church; the meaning of this, the Angell of the Church of Pergamus might be the Angell of the Church of Pergamus; for the Representative Church is the Eldership of that Church.

Ob. 9. From the Church here spoken of, their is no appeale, because the sentence is ratified in Heaven. 2. It inflicteth the highest punishment, the censure of excommunication, and a higher judicature can doe no more. 3. Their is no reason to appeale to a higher judicature, because the inferior may erre, because all above a Congregation are Courts which may erre: for Presbyteries, Provinciall, Nationall, the universall councell of the Catholique Church may erre. So Mr. Mather.

Ob. 10. You grant that a single Congregation in an Island hath power intrinsecall of Excommunication within it selfe; Ergo, th• inconvenient which you put on independent Congregations, shall follow in the case of a remote congregation, Christ hath not then provided sufficiently for that Church in that case.

Ob. 11. If the Church here be a representative Church, the• it hath power from those whom they represent, but they represent the people, and so the power is first in the people, and the people must be the first visible Church, not the presbytery, not a generall councell. I prove the major, because the power the representer hath that must be first in the represented.

Object. 12. That neerest Church to whom we delate the offence of one single offender, is a single Congregation, else we must over-leap this Church, and tell the Presbytery, contrary to Christs direction; but if he heare not that very Church to whom we tell the businesse, he is excommunicated by that neerest Church, as the words beare; Ergo, that nearest Church being single congregations, may excommunicate, and so it is the first Church, and the Presbyterial Church is not the first Church.

Object. 13. If the Congregation may admonish and rebuke, then may they excommunicate, for you may not distinguish where the Law of God distinguisheth not: for there is no reason why this or this exercise of jurisdiction should be given them, and not the exercise of all.

Obj. 14. We doe not thinke that the Church, Math. 18. 16. is the community its alone, nor the Elders there alone; but the Elders in presence of the community. For even Act. 15. when the Apostles andElders did give out decrees, they did it before the Church of Ierusalem, and in their presence, V. 22. Then pleased it the Apostles, Elders, and whole Church, to send chosen men to Antioch. For shew us a warrant in the Word, where the Elders there alone did exercise jurisdiction, the people not being convened, and where such a company of Elders there alone is called a Church. The Iudges in Israel judged in the gates before the people; the Elders judged in, or, before the Church, as the eye seeth united to the head, not separated from it.

Object. 15. Divines bring an argument from Math. 18. by •••logy and proportion from particular congregations, to prove Na•i•nall and generall Synods of the whole Christian world. Ergo, they suppose that a particular Church is the measure and patterne, and first Church which hath power of excommunication,

Object. 16 Here is a particular Church, because here is an offended brother who is a member thereof. This particular Church hath Elders, this particular Church is a whole Church, 1 Cor. 14. if the whole Church come together. Jam. 5. Send for the Elders of the Church. It cannot be, that the sick• person is to send for the Elders of a Presbyteriall Church that are so farre removed from the sicke man.

Object. 17. A Presbyteriall Church can be an offending Church, but this, Math. 18. is for an offending brother, if thy brother sinne against thee, &c.

Object. 18▪There are no Church-censures meant here, Christs scope is to resolve a case of conscience, how farre we are to goe on with an offending brother before we behave our selves to him as to an heather.•, It is said, if thy brother sinne against thee, Ergo, it is a private offence,not a publique Church-scandall, that deserveth excommunication.

Ob. 2. Reprove him, that is, convince him, but is it not reproving to be brought before the Church? must I reprove every one who offendeth me, even the King? it is a mans glory to passe by an offence; and Salomon for biddeth us to over-heare our servant cursing us.

Ob. 3. Tell the Church, is not meant of a Christian Church, but he speaketh of a thing present, but there was no Christian Church as yet.

Ob. 4. It is not much that the word, Church, signifieth onely in this place a company of godly men, witnesses of the mans offence; for〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉signifieth onely once, Joh. 3. the wind. 2. Christ spake in the Syriak and Gnedah, Psal. 22. Gnedah a company, or many Buls have comp•ss•d m•, 1 San. 19. a company of Prophets, Gnedah. The meaning is, if he be not convinced by the testimony of two, rebuke him before many.

Ob. 5. The witnesses sp•ken of here are not witnesses of the offences, but of the reproofe, and therefore there is nothing here of a judiciall proc•s.

Ob. 6. Let him be to thee as an Heathen. He saith not, let him be to the C•urt as an Heathen, and therefore here is no shadow of any Court.

Ob. 7. Whatsoever you bind on earth, is in good sence, that he who offendeth any little one that believeth, his sinne is bound in Heaven, as the friends of Job c. 42. were not accepted of God, till they made their peace first with Iob, yet Iob had no power of the Keyes overhis friends, and an offering is not accepted, while first the offerer be reconciled to his broth•r, and so his sinnes are bound in Heaven, and yet one brother hath not a jurisdiction over another.
It is first objected by our reverend brethren, The extent of the power of jurisdiction in the EldersOb. 2. If Presbyteriall Elders be Elders to mary Congregations in a generall Relation, what sort of 
Ob. 3. It is strange that to excommunicate agreeth to the ruleing Elder in a classicall Presbytery, which he may doe in many Congregations, and so he may performe his principall acts over thirty or forty Congregations; and yet the Pastor may not performe his principall act of teaching in many Congregations, by vertue of his office, but onely in one congregation, by this frame of a classicall Church.

Ob. 4. It is unreasonable that a Prelate or a Pope should rule me, and not teach me, and we condemned this in Prelates that they would onely rule, and not teach: But the classicall presbytery doth fall in that same fault, for they governe the whole classicall Church, but they doe not teach the whole classicall Church; It is dreadfull for a man to watch for the soules of one single Congregation, as being under necessity to give an accempt; Ergo, far more dreadfull it is to watch also for a whole tract of thirty or forty Churches, the Apostle will have Him who watcheth for one flock to entangle himselfe with no other imployments. How then shall hee take the burden of thirty, or forty Flockes?
Objecti. 5. The power of Presbyteries taketh away the power of a Congregation, therefore it cannot b
Object. 6. The Church at the first, for example, when it was but a hundreth and twenty, had the full entire power within it selfe: Ergo, it should bee in a worse case by the multiplication of Churches, if now that power bee given to Presbyteries.
Object. 7. It is absurd that there should be a Church in a Church, and two distinct kind of Churches
Object. 8. If Classicall Presbyters be not Elders in •elation to the classicall Church, and so to all the Congregations in it, yee must forsake all these places, where it is said, the Elders of Jerusalem, the Elders of Ephesus, the Angels of the seven Churches, which is absurd; if they be Elders to all these Churches, then 1. All those people in those Churches must submit their consciences to them and their Ministery, as to a lawfull ordinance of God. 2. All the people of those Churches must have voyce in election of them all. 3. All these people owe to the•s maintenance and double honor. 1 Tim. 5. 17. for if the Oxes mouth must not be muzl•d, but he must be fed by me and my corne, he must tread my corne, and labour for me. These Churches cannot all meet in one, to ordaine, and chuse all these Ministers, and to submit to their Ministery.

Object. 9. But when the Presbytery doth excommunicate in a particular Congregation by a delegate, they may with as good reason, preach by a delegate, as exercise Jurisdiction by a delegate; the one is as personall and incommunicable, as the •••r.

Object. 10. A Pastor is not a Pastor, but in relation to his owne Church, or Congregation. Therefore hee cannot doe Pastorall Acts of either Order, or Jurisdiction in a Presbyterie.

Object, 11. If the Church, which you suppse to be presbyteriall, to wit, the Church of Corinth, did excommunicate, or was commanded to excommunicate the incestu•us person, before the Congregation convened and met in one, then must your classicall Church exercise all other acts of Iurisdiction, before all the Congregationall Churches of the Classicall Presbytery meete in one.

Object. 12. The people are to consent, yea they must have a power, and some thing more than a consent in Excommunication; Ergo, they are all to bee present. The antecedent is proved, 1. Because they were not puffed up, they did not keepe the Feast, they did not dostaine from eating with the incestuous person, onely by consent. 2. Others not of that Church did excommunicate by consent. 3. It is said, v. 12, doe yee not judge them that are within?

Object. 13. The highest and double honour is due to him who laboureth in the word, 1 Tim. 5. 17. but if the Presbyteriall Church be the highest Church, it shall not have the double honour, for it is onely the governing Church.

Object. 14. The Congregation is the highest Church, for it hath all the Ordinances, Word, Sacraments, Jurisdiction; Ergo, there is not any Presbyteriall Church higher which hath only disciplinary power.

Object. 15. The Arguments for a Classicall, or Presbyteriall Church do much side with Prelacy; for you make many Lords ruling and not teaching.

      * ACT. XV.

Object. 2. If ever the Apostles were led by an infallible spirit, 〈◊〉 to bee in a matter like this, which so much concerned the 〈◊〉 and consciences of all the Christian Churches amongst the Gen〈◊〉: E•go, in this Synod they could not bee led by a fallible spirit, but •• an infallible, and so by an Apostolick Spirit.

Object. 3. This is a patterne of all lawfull Synods, then may all lawfull Synods say; It seemed good to the holy Ghost, and to us: if therefore the men might erre, the leader, to wit, the holy Ghost might erre, which is absurd.

Object 4 Is the Apostles did not conclude in this Synod, what they 〈…〉 an Ap s•a ••k spirit, it shall follow that the holy Ghost 〈…〉 15. 28. is not that same holy Ghost of which Peter 〈◊〉, 2 Pet. 1. 21. But holy men of God spake as they were moved 〈◊〉 Ghost, and if so, that holy Ghost which spake in the Pro〈◊◊〉 not also speake in the Apostles.

Object. 5. These decrees, Act. 16. 4. are called the decrees of the Apostles and Elders, but if the Apostles in giving out these decrees gave 〈◊〉 as ordinary Elders, not as Apostles, then the sense of the words, Act. 16. 4. should bee, that they were the decrees of the Elders and of the Elders, which is absued.

They 6. Object. •the Apostles, were in this Synod as ordinary Elders th•n, The Synod might have censured, and in case of obs•inacie excommunicated the Apostles which were admirable.

Object. But it never or seldome in a century falleth out, that a Church is to bee excommunicated, and Christ hath provided Lawes for things onely that fall out ordinarily.

Object. 2. A Synod or presbytery may pr•nounce the d••dfull sentence of non-communion against persons and Churches 〈…〉.

Object. 3. One private man may not doe it, to a whole Church, •• a classicall Presbytery and a Synod hath more authoritie over him, then hee hath over them.

Object. 4. But a Synod or a classicall presbytery hath more 〈◊〉 and authoritie, then one private man, or one single Congregation. 1. Because they are a company of Elders, to whom, as to the Priests of the Lord, whose lips should preserve knowledge, the ••yes of knowledge, and consequently a power and Synodicall authoritie is given, though they have no power of jurisdiction. 2. Because as a private mans power is inferiour to a Pastors, so is the power of classicall and Synodioall meeting of Elders above a man, or a single congregation; and a Synod, in dogmaticall power, ariseth so higher then these, •• divine institution doth fall upon it.

Object. 2. But there is no censuring of persons for scandalls in this meeting, because there is nothing here but a doctrinall declaration of the falsehood of their opinion who taught a necessitie of circumcision; and that all is done by way of doctrine and by power of the Keyes of knowledge, not of jurisdiction, is cleare from the end of this meeting, Act. 5. 2. Paul and Barnabas were sent from the Church of Antioc• unto Jerusalem unto the Apostles and Elders,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, concerning this question, and v. 6. the Apostles and Elders came together to consider,〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉, of this matter, consideration ofMr. Mather and Mr. Thomson against Mr. Herle, c. 1. p. 8.questions being the end of the Synod is a thing belonging to doctrinal power meerely, so Mr. Mather.

3. When as it is said the specification of actions must not bee taken from the efficient cause, but from the formall object, and all that a done in this Synod might have beene done by a single Pastor.

Object. 4. The Acts of this Synod are finaliter acts of government, because they are rules conducing for the governing of the Church, but formaliter, they are acts of dogmaticall power, and not formally acts of jurisdiction, for there is no rebuking of subverters of soules inordine to excommunication, no penall power is exercised here, sub poona, under the paine of excommunication, and therefore there an here no formall acts of government.

Object. 5. The laying on of the yoake spoken of, v. 28. is a meer•, doctrinall yoake, and it importeth no more a poner of jurisdiction, then we can conclude that the obtruders of circumcision bad a power of jurisdiction, because they are said to lay on a yoake also, and to tempt God in so doing, vers. 10.
Object. 6. These decrees which did no other wayes bind the Church of Jerusalem, then they did bind a
Object. 7. They take away the scandall in a doctrinall way only, declaring that they ought to abstaine from things scandalous.

Object. 8. The reason why Patel could not, though hee was an Apostle, determine this at Antioch, was not because hee wanted Apostolick authoritie, but because his Apostolick power was more questionable, hee not having seene Christ in the flesh, nor being a witnesse of the life, death and resurrection of Christ, then the authoritie of James and Peter who wer• eye-witnesses of Christs life, doctrine, and sufferings, and saw him visibly ascend to heaven, and the believers doubted if hee was an Apostle, and the Synod was convened to have theresolution of the Apostles, and so it was meerely Apostolicall.

Object. 9. But it is not cleare that in this act they either censure persons, or doe any thing in order to Church-censure, but onely exercise a naked doctrinall power.

Object. 10. It seemeth that Apostles here determine as Apostles, for they condenme the obtruders of circumcision, because they taught these things without any Apostolick, Commandement, v. 24. They teach that you must bee circumcised and keepe the Law, to whom, wee, (the Apostles) gave no such commandement.
Object. 11. Though the Apostles in this Synod proceed by way of disputing and borrow light one from 
Object. 12. If the Apostles did not in a Synod, with the Elders dispute and voyce as Apostles, it should follow that as Apostles, they did plant Churches, but after the Churches were planted they ceased to bee Apostles, and did all as ordinary Elders, which is most incongr•o•s, for then should they descend from an infallible to a fallible spirit.

Object. 13. Paul exercised the power of the Keyes of knowledge upon Barbarians, and might have preached to Indians, and did pres•h to the scefling Athenians. Ergo, hee might exercise power of jurisdiction over them, and judge those who are without, it is no consequence, and against the word of God, 1 Cor. 5. 12.

Object. 17. From the power of jurisdiction, in a Synod, you may inferre a power of jurisdiction, in a nationall Church, and a power of jurisdiction in the whole Christian world, and wee know not any Politicall Church Catholick and visible in Scripture, and if then were any such Church Catholick, then might they conveene and sweart a Catholick-covenant for uniformitie of doctrine, worship, and government of the Church, as wee have done in Britaine, and this Catholick Church might impose it, upon a nationall Church, even by that same Law of proportion, by which the nationall Church may impose it on particular Churches which are parts of the Nationall Church.

Object. 18. But you cannot demonstrate from Gods Word, that there is such a thing in the New Testament, as a Catholick visible Church.

Object. 2. If one should say, God hath placed in the common-wealth Emperours, Kings, Dukes, Princes and Rulers, as the eyes and eares of the Commonwealth, it should no wayes follow that all the Commonwealths in the earth are one visible civill body having a government, so though it hee said God hath placed in the spirituall Commonwealths of the Church Apostles, Prophets, Teachers, &c. it followeth not that the Church is all one spirituall, politick visible body, it followeth onely that the Lord hath placed in the Church Apostles, Prophets, Teachers indefinitly, that is, that these may bee in any one single Congregation, as it is said, James 2. 2. If there come into your Assembly, or Synagogue, a man with a gold Ring, &c. now this will not prove that all the dispersed Jewes, to whom James wrote, were all but one Congregation.

Object. 2. The Apostles went to Jerusalem by revelation, as Paul did, Gal. 1. Ergo, all their acts that they did there, they did them by immediate revelation.

Object. 3. If the Apostles did act as Presbyters here, they did wrong the particular Churches, and took their Liberty from them, in exercising ordinary Ministeriall acts there, which are proper to that Church.

Object. 4. If there were no institution for preaching and baptizing, but onely the Apostles naked practise, we were not warrantably to preach and baptize from the sole and naked example of the Apostles.
